_it is basically a malicious node is detected using blockchain. 

This project presents a framework for converting wireless signals into structured datasets, which can be fed into machine learning algorithms for the detection of active eavesdropping attacks at the physical layer. More specifically, a wireless communication system, which consists of an access point (AP), K legitimate users and an active eavesdropper, is considered. 

To detect the eavesdropper who breaks into the system during the authentication phase, 


we first build structured datasets based on different features and then apply sophisticated support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to those structured datasets.


To be more specific, we first process the signals received by the AP and then define a pair of statistical features based on the post-processing of the signals. By arranging for the AP to simulate the entire process of transmission and the process of constructing features, we form the so-called artificial training data (ATD).
Recent advances in the digital actual shrewd framework (CPSG) have empowered a wide scope of new gadgets dependent on the data and correspondence innovation (ICT). Nonetheless, these ICT-empowered gadgets are powerless to a developing danger of digital actual assaults. This paper plays out an intensive audit of the best in class digital actual security of the savvy framework. 


By zeroing in on the actual layer of the CPSG, this paper gives a preoccupied and bound together state-space model, in which digital actual assault and protection models can be successfully summed up. The current digital actual assaults are sorted as far as their target parts._
